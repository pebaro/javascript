======================
To Do List Application 
======================

Another simple app but using some advanced techniques and modern ES6 code. 

NOTE: When loading this app it will load without any data so you will need to create a few simple items, for example: One, Two, Three, Four, Five 

This app uses a simple function to create unique IDs for each ToDo instead of using UUIDV4 (as used in the Notes Application) which is great, but overkill for the needs of apps like this. 

Filtering can be done using the input field and will work on anything shown in the list. 

If you tick any of the checkboxes to show that an item is completed, the number shown in the above sentence will change to reflect this. 

If you tick the checkbox next to ‘hide completed todos:’ you will see all checked items in the list disappear. 

Input field for entering ToDo items has been set up to stay selected after you hit enter to allow for faster input to the ToDo list. 

Code uses the class syntax and arrow functions.
