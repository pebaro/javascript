This small program was a coding challenge as part of the first javascript course I did so I thought it was worth including

NOTES:

1. Works best if you enter the Amount Due as a decimal value such eg. 27.12 as this will give you a more in depth breakdown
2. When you enter the amounts enter them just as numbers, don't add a £ or $ sign
3. When you enter the Amount Given you'll get a better breakdown if you enter a higher amount eg. 100 for £100
